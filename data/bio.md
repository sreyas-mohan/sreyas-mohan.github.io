I am a Staff Research Scientist at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com), working at the intersection of Generative AI and 3D world perception, understanding, and creation.

Previously, I co-developed a photorealistic “AI twin” system for video calling, capable of rendering lifelike appearances and animating them with highly realistic conversational dynamics. This work was featured in [Mark Zuckerberg’s Connect 2024 demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezXhxAkhJfk&t=3623s&ab_channel=VRelity) and supported by [open-source models and datasets](https://ai.meta.com/blog/seamless-interaction-natural-conversational-dynamics/) that have enabled further research. My broader work spans three areas: the generation of images, videos, and 3D content; multimodal systems; and computational photography.

I also have a deep interest in using AI to push the boundaries of scientific discovery. In collaboration with materials scientists, I developed an AI-based denoising method for electron microscopy images, which revealed [previously unobserved atomic-scale dynamics](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads2688).

I earned my Ph.D. from the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/about/) at New York University, advised by [Prof. Carlos Fernandez-Granda](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/) and [Prof. Eero P. Simoncelli](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/), and my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in), working with [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/). I have also held research positions at [Google](https://about.google), [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at), and the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/).
